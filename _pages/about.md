**About Me**

Hello! Iâ€™m Avash Palikhe, a Ph.D. student at the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University (FIU), USA. I am a researcher and an engineer passionate about building innovative, efficient, and responsible AI systems to address complex real-world challenges.

 Over the years, my academic and professional pursuits have increasingly focused on advancing research at the intersection of artificial intelligence, algorithmic fairness, and model interpretability.

**Research Interest**

My current research centers on algorithmic fairness, explainable AI, and ethical AI Specifically, my work aims to better understand and mitigate biases in AI systems and contribute to the development of transparent and ethically aligned models. I strongly believe that the advancement of AI should go hand-in-hand with responsibility, accountability, and social awareness.

Beyond academia, I enjoy exploring innovative ideas, contributing to impactful AI projects, and engaging with communities that promote ethical and responsible technology development.
