**About Me**

Hello! I’m Avash Palikhe, a Ph.D. student at the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University (FIU), USA. I am a researcher and engineer passionate about designing innovative, efficient, and responsible AI systems to address complex real-world challenges.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Tribhuvan University, Nepal. Over the years, my academic and professional pursuits have increasingly focused on advancing research at the intersection of artificial intelligence, algorithmic fairness, and model interpretability.

**Research Interest**

My current research centers on machine learning, with a particular focus on AI fairness and explainability. I aim to better understand and mitigate biases in AI systems and contribute to the development of transparent, ethically aligned models. I strongly believe that the advancement of AI should go hand-in-hand with responsibility, accountability, and social awareness.

Beyond academia, I enjoy exploring innovative ideas, contributing to impactful AI projects, and engaging with communities that promote ethical and responsible technology development.

Thank you for visiting my website! Feel free to explore my work or  [reach out](mailto:avashpalikhework@gmail.com) if you'd like to connect or collaborate.
